# Big-Data-Analysis-on-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Spark-
A Spark big data project analyzing a large financial transaction dataset with more than 100,000 customer transaction records. and some machine learning models are built to predict fraudulent records and then evaluated.

#Use pyspark and sql to input and store data, and perform data cleaning to identify invalid data values and missing data values.

#Use python and pyspark to perform basic data analysis and classify the types of predictor variables. And analyze the correlation between fraudulent behavior records and transaction types.

#Transform the dataset to build some machine learning model to predict fraudulent behavior records in the credit card dataset, such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression with weights or without weights  model, and use Binary Classification Evaluator to evaluate the performance of these models.

#Utilized:Python,Pyspark,Spark,SQL,AWS,Amazon S3,Matplotlib,Machine Learning, Random Forest,Logistic Regression,Binary Classification Evaluator,areaUnderPR.
